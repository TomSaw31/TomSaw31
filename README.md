<p>My name is Thomas Saurel, and I'm a Computer Science and Mathematics student from Toulouse, France 🥖🍷.</p>

<p>I have a deep love for video game development 🎮, where I aim to create fun and engaging experiences that players will remember. I believe games can be a powerful way to tell stories and connect people. My interest in science 🔬 inspires me to explore new ideas and find creative solutions to complex challenges. I enjoy the process of experimenting and learning, whether it’s through coding or designing gameplay mechanics.</p>
